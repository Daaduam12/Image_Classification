This project holds immense personal significance for me; the profound impact it can have on the lives of cocoa farmers in Ghana serves as a constant driving force.
Cocoa farmers face considerable economic losses each year due to a range of diseases affecting cocoa plants.

The primary threats include Black Pod, Witches Broom, Frosty Pod, Swollen Shoot Virus, and Vascular Streak Dieback, with Black Pod and Frosty Pod standing out as particularly harmful to Ghanaian Cocoa Farmers.
Emphasizing the similarities between Black Pod and Frosty Pod becomes crucial, underscoring the necessity for early identification by farmers. A farmer's ability to accurately distinguish these diseases in their initial stages and promptly apply the appropriate treatment is pivotal for minimizing losses.


## OBJECTIVE

This project aims to create a mobile application that allows farmers to scan or capture images of affected cocoa pods. The application will then analyze and identify the specific disease affecting the plant. The provided feedback will empower farmers to confidently choose the appropriate treatment for the identified disease.

## PERFORMED TASKS

The undertaken tasks encompassed the creation of a dataset for both training and testing purposes, followed by the storage of the dataset. Subsequently, an image classification model was developed and trained using the established dataset. The model was then tested with a separate dataset that was not included in the training dataset.
